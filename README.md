# Numerical Assignments in Thermal Physics. 

Also included some drafts and suggestions for numerical assignments in Optics. This is as far as I got in the process. 

These assignments are used in the course TFY4165 - Thermal Physics at Norwegian University of Science and Technology - NTNU. 
Solutions have naturally also been made, but these have not been made public for obvious reasons.
